            <h1>Components & Props</h1>
            </a>
            <p>React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide
                more features which are described in detail on this page. To define a React component class, you need to
                extend React.Component:</p>
            <p>The render() method is the only required method in a class component.
            <p>These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and
                inserted into the DOM:

                constructor()
                static getDerivedStateFromProps()
                render()
                componentDidMount()
                Note:

                These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:

                UNSAFE_componentWillMount()
                Updating
                An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order
                when a component is being re-rendered:

                static getDerivedStateFromProps()
                shouldComponentUpdate()
                render()
                getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                componentDidUpdate()
                Note:

                These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:

                UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()
                UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()
                Unmounting
                This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

                componentWillUnmount()
                Error Handling
                These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the
                constructor of any child component.

                static getDerivedStateFromError()
                componentDidCatch()
                Other APIs
                Each component also provides some other APIs:

                setState()
                forceUpdate()
                Class Properties
                defaultProps
                displayName
                Instance Properties
                props
                state
                Reference
                Commonly Used Lifecycle Methods
                The methods in this section cover the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter creating React
                components. For a visual reference, check out this lifecycle diagram.

                render()
            </p>
            <p>The render() method is the only required method in a class component.

                When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return one of the following types:
                
                React elements. Typically created via JSX. For example, < div /> and < MyComponent /> are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.
                Arrays and fragments. Let you return multiple elements from render. See the documentation on fragments for more details.
                Portals. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on portals for more details.
                String and numbers. These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
                Booleans or null. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support return test && < Child /> pattern, where test is boolean.)
                The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.
                
                If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping render() pure makes components easier to think about.
                
                Note
                
                render() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
