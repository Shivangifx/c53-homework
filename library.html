            <h1>Libraries</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Every app is made up of some combination of React Native, Expo SDK, and third party libraries. It's important to understand how to use the libraries from each of these sources, and how to determine whether a third-party library will work in your project or not.
                If you are using the bare workflow, read the guide for using libraries in the bare workflow instead of this page.</p>
        <p>React Native provides a set of built-in primitives that most developers will need in their app. These include components such as ActivityIndicator, TextInput, Text, ScrollView, and View. These are listed in the Core Components and APIs page of the React Native documentation. We also list the React Native Core Components and APIs in the API Reference section of the Expo documentation, so you can quickly see the documentation relevant to the SDK version that your app uses in the same place as you would find it for Expo SDK libraries. You can see the React Native version that corresponds to your Expo SDK version in the table on the API Reference index.
            The react-native core library is installed automatically in every Expo app. To use a React Native library in your project, import it from the react-native package in your code:</p>
        <p>The Expo SDK picks up where the React Native core libraries end - it provides access to a lot of useful device and system functionality like audio, barcode scanning, camera, calendar, contacts, video, and so on. It also adds other powerful libraries like over-the-air updates, maps, OAuth authentication tools, and more. For details on how we decide what goes into the Expo SDK, read here.
            To use a library from the Expo SDK, find the one you are looking for in the API Reference or through the documentation Search bar.
            At the top of the page you will see a description of the library and a platform compatibility table. It tells you which platforms and environments the library is compatible with. It looks like this:
        Web:compatible IOS:compatible Android:compatible</p>   
        <p>React Native Directory is a searchable database of libraries built specifically for React Native. If the library that you are looking for is not provided by React Native or Expo then this is the best place to look first when trying to find a library for your app.
            After React Native Directory, the npm registry is the next best place. The npm registry is the definitive source for JavaScript libraries, but the libraries that it lists may not all be compatible with React Native. React Native is one of many JavaScript programming environments, including Node.js, web browsers, Electron, and more, and npm includes libraries that work for all of these environments. Other libraries may be compatible with React Native, but not compatible with the Expo managed workflow. How do you figure this out?
            Determining Third-Party Library Compatibility
            Check React Native Directory: find the library on the website (if it's there) and verify that it has a "✔️ Expo client" tag. You can also enable the filter by Expo client option to only show libraries that are compatible with the Expo managed workflow.
            Not listed on the directory? find the project on GitHub, an easy way to do this is with npx npm-home --github < package-name >. For example, to open the GitHub page for react-native-localize you would run:</p>
